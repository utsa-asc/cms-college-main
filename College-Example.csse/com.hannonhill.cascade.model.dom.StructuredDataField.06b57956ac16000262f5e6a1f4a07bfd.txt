getText:java.lang.String:As a result of the partnership, MITRE developed a summer internship program and began recruiting UTSA students for what has become a prestigious, highly sought-after and rewarding opportunity. In Summer 2019, MITRE hired two UTSA interns, one of which was David Akusu, who ended up continuing as a year-long intern. The other summer intern, Michael King, was offered a full-time position with MITRE after he graduated from UTSA in December.
